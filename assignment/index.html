    <ul>
      <li>I might be misunderstanding #3 of the stretch goals, but when creating the isFull function, should the function limit the array to 5 items?
      For example, if the maxItems is set to 5 and the return value is set to true if there are 5 or more items, should one still be able to add more items into the basket? Is there a way to completely block the addition of more items?
      </li>
    </ul>
